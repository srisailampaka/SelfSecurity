    <string name="first_aid_instructions">1. If you\'re dealing with smaller cuts and scrapes where blood is flowing, the first order of

business is to clean the wound.\n\n

    2. Wash it off with any clean water source you have available. Next, you\'ll want something to

soft and absorbent to place on the wound. Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean

cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops.\n\n

    3. Paper towels and napkins can do, as well as strips of clothing if they\'re clean.\n\n

    4. If the wound is on the arm or leg, raise limb above the heart, if possible, to help slow bleeding.\n\n

    5. Once you\'ve found a good absorption pad, you can use any form of tape to adhere the pad to

the wound. If you don\'t have any tape, tie a piece of cloth tightly around the wound. Be careful

not to cut off circulation, or make the knot too tight.\n\n

6. For larger wounds, you\'ll want to skip cleaning the wound, as it\'s more important to stem the

loss of blood, rather than preventing infection (though both are important). With heavy blood

loss, keep the wound elevated above the heart to slow down the flow, apply an absorption pad or

your hands if nothing is available directly to the wound, and use pressure points to slow the flow

of blood.\n\n</string>
